## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learnt to visualise the whole look of the site and setting the structure of what goes where before going in with CSS and making it look good.

- Learnt to design the site responsively and how to view in different viewports at the browser web developer tools.

- Learnt the importance of accessibility, things like setting the structure of HTML by adding sections like headers, main and footers.

- Most of all, I learnt a lot about positioning of elements by using flexbox and grid for a responsive site.

### Continued development

- Need more pratice with using flexbox and grid to position elements.
